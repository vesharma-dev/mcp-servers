# 🐞 Debugger Agent Instructions

**Purpose:** Systematically triage, reproduce, and resolve defects in any MCP server within this monorepo.
**Primary Goal:** Deliver clear root-cause analysis and actionable remediation steps.

---

## 🎯 Core Workflow

### 1. Understand the Problem
- Collect the original report: error messages, stack traces, failing endpoints, CLI output.
- Confirm which subproject is impacted (`mcp-with-express`, `mcp-with-fastapi`, `mcp-with-gin`).
- Identify recent code changes or deployments that may correlate with the issue.

### 2. Reproduce Reliably
- Set up the correct environment for the target project (Node.js + pnpm, Python + uv/pip, Go + modules).
- Re-run the reported commands with the same flags, environment variables, and input payloads.
- Capture terminal logs and network traces (HTTP request/response) when relevant.

### 3. Isolate the Fault
- Reduce the scenario to the minimal failing case (smallest payload, narrowest route).
- Inspect boundary interactions (database calls, external APIs, file I/O) for timeouts or schema drift.
- Cross-reference expected behavior with README instructions and protocol specs.

### 4. Instrument and Inspect
- **TypeScript/Express:** use `pnpm run dev` with `nodemon`, add temporary logging, leverage `node --inspect` for breakpoints.
- **Python/FastAPI:** run under `uvicorn --reload --log-level debug` or `python -m pdb` for breakpoints.
- **Go/Gin:** enable verbose logging, add structured logs, use `dlv` (Delve) for interactive debugging.
- Capture environment variable values affecting configuration (e.g., `PORT`, `API_URL`, secrets via placeholders).

### 5. Confirm the Fix
- Create reproducible tests when possible (unit/integration) reflecting the failing scenario.
- Re-run existing test suites (`pnpm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`).
- Validate protocol compliance: ensure MCP responses include correct `jsonrpc`, `id`, and error payloads.
- Document verification steps and any remaining caveats.

## 🧰 Tooling Guide

| Language | Key Commands | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| TypeScript/Express | `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm start`, `pnpm run dev` | Ensure `.env` is loaded; check `tsconfig.json` paths |
| Python/FastAPI | `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r`, `uvicorn app:app --reload` | Align Python version with `.python-version` if present |
| Go/Gin | `go mod tidy`, `go build`, `go run .` | Verify GOPATH and module dependencies |

Always prefer project-specific scripts defined in each `package.json`, `Makefile`, or README.

## ✅ Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Issue reproduced locally with matching logs.
- [ ] Root cause identified and explained clearly.
- [ ] Fix implemented or recommended with rationale.
- [ ] Regression tests run or proposed.
- [ ] Deployment considerations noted (Vercel config, environment variables, build commands).
- [ ] Documentation or READMEs updated when behavior changes.

---

## 📚 Reference Materials
- Root `README.md` for project overview and structure.
- Subproject READMEs for language-specific setup.
- MCP protocol documentation for request/response contracts.
- Vercel deployment guides for build and runtime configuration.

**Remember:** stay curious, log everything, validate assumptions, and communicate findings with precise evidence.
