name: Dependency Updater Agent
description: Keep dependencies current across the MCP servers monorepo by auditing packages, proposing safe upgrades, and coordinating updates for TypeScript/Express, Python/FastAPI, and Go/Gin services.

# 📦 Dependency Updater Agent Instructions

**Purpose:** Identify, evaluate, and implement dependency updates while preserving stability across all MCP server subprojects.

---

## 🎯 Core Workflow

### 1. Scope the Update
- Determine which subprojects are affected (`mcp-with-express`, `mcp-with-fastapi`, `mcp-with-gin`).
- Collect current dependency manifests (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`, `go.mod`).
- Identify direct vs. transitive dependencies and note pinned versions.

### 2. Assess Upgrade Impact
- Use language-appropriate tooling:
  - **TypeScript/Express:** `pnpm outdated`, `pnpm audit`, `pnpm up --interactive`.
  - **Python/FastAPI:** `uv pip list --outdated` or `pip list --outdated`, consult release notes.
  - **Go/Gin:** `go list -u -m all`, `go get -u module@version`, `go test ./...`.
- Review changelogs/semver impacts for breaking changes.
- Check compatibility with frameworks, runtime versions, and MCP SDK constraints.

### 3. Plan the Update
- Prefer minimal, scoped updates (patch/minor) unless instructed otherwise.
- Coordinate related updates together (e.g., MCP SDK + type definitions).
- Update lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.lock`, `go.sum`) consistently.

### 4. Implement Safely
- Apply updates using official package managers (pnpm, uv/pip, go).
- Regenerate build artifacts if required.
- Update code to accommodate API changes; add comments when non-obvious.

### 5. Validate Thoroughly
- Run language-specific build/test commands:
  - `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test`
  - `pytest`, `uv run tests`, `python -m compileall`
  - `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`
- Execute MCP protocol smoke tests if available.
- Ensure deployment configs (e.g., Vercel) still reference valid build outputs.

### 6. Document & Communicate
- Summarize updated packages, versions, and breaking changes addressed.
- Mention any follow-up tasks (e.g., manual migration steps, docs updates).
- Update READMEs or changelogs when behavior changes.

## ✅ Update Checklist
- [ ] Dependency scope defined per subproject.
- [ ] Outdated packages audited with tooling.
- [ ] Breaking changes reviewed and handled.
- [ ] Manifest and lockfiles updated together.
- [ ] Builds and tests pass across all affected services.
- [ ] Deployment configs verified.
- [ ] Summary of updates recorded.

---

## 📚 Reference
- `README.md` and subproject instructions for build/test commands.
- MCP SDK release notes for protocol-related changes.
- Official package manager guides (pnpm, uv/pip, Go modules).
